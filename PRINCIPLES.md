# Development Principles

## Core Philosophy
- **Minimalism First**: Every feature, design element, and code decision should prioritize simplicity and clarity
- **Clean Code**: Write readable, maintainable, and well-documented code
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
- **Scalable Architecture**: Design for multiple users and future growth

## Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Clean lines, ample white space, subtle shadows
- **Typography**: Use a single, readable font family with clear hierarchy
- **Color Palette**: Limited to 2-3 primary colors plus grays
- **Consistency**: Maintain visual consistency across all components
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Users should understand the interface immediately
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only what's necessary, reveal more as needed
- **Fast Feedback**: Immediate visual feedback for all user actions
- **Error Prevention**: Design to prevent errors before they occur
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works on all devices

## Technical Principles

### Code Quality
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function/component has one clear purpose
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow object-oriented design principles
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for better code reliability
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency

### Testing Strategy
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% test coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Test Data**: Use consistent, realistic test data

### Architecture
- **Component-Based**: Modular, reusable components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **State Management**: Centralized, predictable state handling
- **API Design**: RESTful, consistent endpoints
- **Database Design**: Normalized, efficient schema

### Styling Approach
- **CSS-in-JS**: Use styled-components for component-scoped styles
- **Design System**: Consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints
- **Theme Support**: Support for light/dark modes
- **Performance**: Optimize CSS for fast rendering

## Development Workflow
- **Feature Branches**: Work on features in separate branches
- **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merging
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on every commit
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation up-to-date
- **Refactoring**: Regularly refactor to maintain code quality

## Scalability Considerations
- **Database**: Use efficient queries and proper indexing
- **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies
- **CDN**: Use content delivery networks for static assets
- **Load Balancing**: Design for horizontal scaling
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Security
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization
- **Data Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **HTTPS**: Use secure connections everywhere
- **Privacy**: Protect user data and privacy
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated

## Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Load components and data as needed
- **Optimization**: Minimize bundle size and optimize assets
- **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies
- **Monitoring**: Track performance metrics
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure basic functionality works without JavaScript

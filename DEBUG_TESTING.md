# 🐛 Debug Testing Tools

This project includes comprehensive debugging tools to test habit logic without waiting for days or weeks to see results.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Previously, testing habit tracking logic was extremely difficult because:
- You had to wait actual days/weeks to test streaks
- Production bugs were hard to reproduce
- Timezone issues only appeared in certain conditions
- Complex edge cases (like Sunday week calculations) were hard to test

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### 1. Web Debug Interface

**URL**: `/debug` (visible when signed in)

**Features**:
- **Test Scenarios**: Pre-built scenarios that recreate common bugs
- **Manual Testing**: Toggle habits on specific dates
- **Real-time Inspection**: See logs and streak calculations
- **Quick Tests**: One-click testing of critical scenarios

**Usage**:
1. Sign in to your app
2. Click "🐛 Debug" in the header
3. Select a test scenario or create custom tests
4. Watch real-time results and logs

### 2. Command Line Script

**⚠️ Note**: The command line script requires authentication and currently doesn't work standalone. Use the web interface instead.

**Intended Usage** (currently not functional):
```bash
# Test specific scenarios (requires auth)
node scripts/test-habit-scenarios.js daily-streak
node scripts/test-habit-scenarios.js weekly-sunday
node scripts/test-habit-scenarios.js production-bug
node scripts/test-habit-scenarios.js timezone-mix

# List all available scenarios
node scripts/test-habit-scenarios.js
```

**Current Status**: Returns "Unauthorized" error because it can't authenticate with the API. Use the web debug interface at `/debug` instead.

**Output Example**:
```
🧪 Testing: Daily Streak Test
📝 Tests consecutive daily habits with gaps
==================================================
⚙️  Setting up scenario...
✅ Setup complete: Test scenario "Daily Streak Test" set up successfully
🎯 Testing habit: Test Daily Habit (daily)
📊 Initial streak: 0

📅 Testing Saturday (2025-06-28)...
   Before: Calculated streak = 0
   Action: Created new completed log
   Result: Streak 0 → 1

📅 Testing Sunday (2025-06-29)...
   Before: Calculated streak = 1
   Action: Created new completed log
   Result: Streak 1 → 2

📋 Final state:
   Logs:
     2025-01-01: ✅

   Current streak: 2
   Best streak: 2
```

### 3. API Endpoints

**Base URL**: `/api/debug/test-habits`

**Actions**:
- `?action=list-scenarios` - List available test scenarios
- `?action=setup&scenario=X` - Set up a test scenario
- `?action=simulate-toggle&habitId=X&date=YYYY-MM-DD` - Simulate toggling a habit
- `?action=inspect&habitId=X&date=YYYY-MM-DD` - Inspect habit state

## 📋 Test Scenarios

### `daily-streak`
**Purpose**: Tests consecutive daily habits with gaps  
**Tests**: Yesterday, today, tomorrow toggles  
**Validates**: Daily streak calculation, gap handling

### `weekly-sunday`
**Purpose**: Tests the critical Sunday calculation bug  
**Tests**: Sunday habit toggles  
**Validates**: Week boundary calculation, Sunday edge case

### `production-bug`
**Purpose**: Recreates the exact production issue  
**Tests**: Mixed timezone logs, weekly habits  
**Validates**: Timezone handling, production scenario

### `timezone-mix`
**Purpose**: Tests habits with logs in different timezones  
**Tests**: UTC, UTC+7, UTC+12 logs  
**Validates**: Timezone-agnostic date comparisons

## 🚀 Quick Testing Workflow

### For New Features
1. Use the web interface to set up relevant scenarios
2. Test edge cases with manual date selection
3. Verify streak calculations across date boundaries

### For Bug Reports
1. Recreate the scenario using the debug tools
2. Use the inspect feature to see detailed calculations
3. Test the fix with the same scenario

### For Production Deployment
1. Run all command-line scenarios: `node scripts/test-habit-scenarios.js daily-streak && node scripts/test-habit-scenarios.js weekly-sunday && node scripts/test-habit-scenarios.js production-bug`
2. Verify all tests pass before deploying

## 🎯 Key Benefits

✅ **Instant Testing**: Test days, weeks, months of scenarios in seconds  
✅ **Reproducible**: Exact same test conditions every time  
✅ **Comprehensive**: Covers all major edge cases and bugs  
✅ **Real-time Feedback**: See immediate results and calculations  
✅ **Production-Safe**: Uses separate "Test" habits that don't affect real data  

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Isolation
- All test habits have titles starting with "Test "
- Test habits are automatically cleaned up between scenarios
- Real user habits are never affected

### Calculation Accuracy
- Uses the exact same streak calculation logic as production
- Tests both daily and weekly habit types
- Validates timezone handling and date boundary edge cases

### Debugging Features
- Logs show which entries were modified during testing
- Streak calculations are shown for multiple dates around the test date
- Real-time output shows before/after states

This debug system makes it possible to confidently develop and deploy habit tracking features without the anxiety of waiting days to see if they work correctly! 🎉
